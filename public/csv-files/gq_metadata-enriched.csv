Amazon  or  Ikea  gift cards and wads of cash will never cease to be great  gifts for the new grad  you don’t want to shoehorn with personalized  jewelry  or a tie. And yet, it never hurts to turn up to a graduation party with something physical that you’ve thought out. For grad gifts, now’s the time to shell out for an elevated version of something they need, like new  linens  and tech accessories, or some high-quality life investment that they may never have considered, like a souped-up steamer or  charging device  that they can pack up and carry from place to place. Celebratory niceties and life-enhancing subscriptions are also well-deserved for any graduate, especially if they’ve been footing the bill for student loans. Here, we’ve assembled some of the best graduation gift ideas for everyone on your list, whether they’re leaving the nest after their high school graduation, a recent college grad who’s heading into the real world or back into school, or perhaps just toiled their way through a secondary degree—from  travel essentials  for post-grad gap years to useful home and cooking tools that can upgrade any dorm room or sad first sublet.

But, as they say, practice makes perfect. Holidays and moments that require grand gesturing aside,  anytime  is really a great time to show your leading lady how much she means to you (and how well you listen).

Leaning into any one of these themes is going to make the gift a little more meaningful once it's in her hands.

2022-12-15T08:00:00-05:00,"Gift shopping  for guys who have god-tier taste can be a royal headache, but the best gift sets for men are less of a shot in the dark, and more of an assortment of stellar ideas—a way of saying “something in this box  has  to be a good fit.” For people with, shall we say,  highly specific  preferences, gift sets make finding the perfect bundle of winter accessories or top-shelf  grooming  staples an absolute breeze—especially when you're on a time crunch, like, say, the week before Christmas. So with that in mind, it's time to do away with the notion that gift sets are only for people who don't really know each other—in fact, they might be some of the most thoughtful presents on the planet. Who  doesn't  enjoy the surprise of expecting one gift and unwrapping  several ? (The more the merrier, indeed!) The added bonus for you, the gift giver, is that they take the guesswork entirely out of the equation, with GQ-approved bundles that just so happen to pair perfectly together.

Art books. Whereas a physical gift—perhaps a disappointing pair of socks or a candle—can emphasize a lack of depth or thought (never one of our picks, of course), a really bang-up  coffee table book  does the opposite.

2022-12-07T16:40:24-05:00,"No matter what the sibling dynamics—we hate to infer anything—shopping for the best gifts for brothers (and spiritual brothers, let's not discount our closest friends) should ideally turn up options that are more imaginative than a portable phone charger. Still, brothers can be difficult to shop for. They’re elusive, they insist they don’t want anything, or they have everything, or they intentionally own nothing—it’s always something. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t agree on some level. Which is why we would like to cleanse you of your brother-gift-giving anxiety. To remind you that  buying gifts  should be fun, even when you’ve selected something simple or practical. To give you permission to go for something you think is a wonderful choice for him, and if he doesn’t get it? Well, that’s what  Christmas  is for. Our favorite gifts for brothers on this list range from an ultra-luxe power generator to the perfect pack of ribbed  dress socks . We hope something catches your eye, and delights him in the process. Gather yourself, and gift on with confidence. And remember: Your brother loves you no matter what.

2022-12-06T14:14:11-05:00,"Finding the best  gifts  for coworkers—ones that are reasonably priced, yet still more thoughtful than a giant stack of sticky notes and a Starbucks gift card—can be as headache-inducing as a messy Excel spreadsheet. But in our eyes, there are a couple easy ways to go about it. The best coworker gifts should speak to their services as a tidy desk companion, occasional confidante, sterling mentor, and perhaps even a colleague that has transitioned to a real bona fide  friend  outside of work. Ideally, these gifts will also improve their lives beyond the tiny cubicle that dominates their daylight hours (or beyond the subsection of their apartment that's now their glorified office, if your team is still  mostly remote ). Here, we've compiled several gift ideas that will extend your favorite coworkers a little token of thanks, like a massager for physical relief after a long day hunched over a screen,  succulents  to add some living things to their lonely home office, and even a couple  gift sets  for the colleagues that are a little harder to pin down. Whatever their tastes, whatever your budget, these are some of the very best gifts for coworkers in 2022.
