Still, brothers can be difficult to shop for. They’re elusive, they insist they don’t want anything, or they have everything, or they intentionally own nothing—it’s always something. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t agree on some level. Which is why we would like to cleanse you of your brother-gift-giving anxiety. To remind you that  buying gifts  should be fun, even when you’ve selected something simple or practical. To give you permission to go for something you think is a wonderful choice for him, and if he doesn’t get it? Well, that’s what  Christmas  is for. Our favorite gifts for brothers on this list range from an ultra-luxe power generator to the perfect pack of ribbed  dress socks . We hope something catches your eye, and delights him in the process. Gather yourself, and gift on with confidence. And remember: Your brother loves you no matter what.

The best coworker gifts should speak to their services as a tidy desk companion, occasional confidante, sterling mentor, and perhaps even a colleague that has transitioned to a real bona fide  friend  outside of work. Ideally, these gifts will also improve their lives beyond the tiny cubicle that dominates their daylight hours (or beyond the subsection of their apartment that's now their glorified office, if your team is still  mostly remote ). Here, we've compiled several gift ideas that will extend your favorite coworkers a little token of thanks, like a massager for physical relief after a long day hunched over a screen,  succulents  to add some living things to their lonely home office, and even a couple  gift sets  for the colleagues that are a little harder to pin down. Whatever their tastes, whatever your budget, these are some of the very best gifts for coworkers in 2022.
