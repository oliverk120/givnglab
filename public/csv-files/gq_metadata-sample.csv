https://www.gq.com/gallery/best-graduation-gift-ideas,The Best Graduation Gift Ideas Will Ease Them Into Whatever’s Next,"The best graduation  gift  ideas for every kind of graduate are nice enough to help usher them into their next phase of life, realistic to their needs, and ideally something slightly beyond the grasp of a cash-strapped student’s budget.  Amazon  or  Ikea  gift cards and wads of cash will never cease to be great  gifts for the new grad  you don’t want to shoehorn with personalized  jewelry  or a tie. And yet, it never hurts to turn up to a graduation party with something physical that you’ve thought out. For grad gifts, now’s the time to shell out for an elevated version of something they need, like new  linens  and tech accessories, or some high-quality life investment that they may never have considered, like a souped-up steamer or  charging device  that they can pack up and carry from place to place. Celebratory niceties and life-enhancing subscriptions are also well-deserved for any graduate, especially if they’ve been footing the bill for student loans. Here, we’ve assembled some of the best graduation gift ideas for everyone on your list, whether they’re leaving the nest after their high school graduation, a recent college grad who’s heading into the real world or back into school, or perhaps just toiled their way through a secondary degree—from  travel essentials  for post-grad gap years to useful home and cooking tools that can upgrade any dorm room or sad first sublet.

Look, we all  want  to buy people  cashmere  and  noise-cancelling AirPods , but spending gobs of cash on a gift (especially for someone you don't really know) isn't always realistic. Even the people you love the most can't push you to go into debt just to get them an expensive item.

And to top it all off, get  the nice wrapping paper  to seal that deal that you aren't a cheap bastard and you do, in fact, care. Here are some great gifts under $100 that'll keep some cash in your wallet and you in the good graces of your giftee.",2023-02-21T15:25:27-05:00
